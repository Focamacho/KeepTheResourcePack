# Keep the ResourcePack <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/keep-the-resourcepack"><img src="http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_502908_downloads.svg"></a>

A simple client-side utility mod that keeps the server ResourcePack always loaded.<br>
Not everyone has a beefy PC, so having ResourcePacks loading and unloading everytime you join/leave the server is painful.

This mod also caches the latest server ResourcePack and loads it when the game is starting.<br>
The result is the player having to load the ResourcePack only one time.

The main focus of this mod is modpacks with a server included, so they can keep the resourcepack on their server instead of inside the modpack (making it easier to update), without making the life of their players harder.
